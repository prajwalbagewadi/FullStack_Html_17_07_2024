        The color name depicts the specific name for the HTML
        color. There are 140 color names supported.

        The RGB value defines HTML color by mixing red, green, and blue values. 
        The first number describes the red color input, 
        the second – the green color input,
        and the third one – the blue color input.
        The value of each color can vary from 0 to 255. 
        For example, to get the red we would have to use RGB(255,0,171)

        <p style="color: white;">rgb method:</p>
        <p style="background-color:rgb(40,20,180);color:rgb(255,255,255)">color of text.</p>
        <!--
        RGBA values are very similar, they have one more value. 
        The additional fourth value A stands for alpha and represents the opacity.
        It can be defined in a number from 0 (not transparent)
        to 1 (completely transparent):

        <p style="color: white;">rgba method:</p>

        <!--
        HEX color value works pretty similarly to RGB .
        To describe the intensity of the color using HEX, the code
        contains both numbers from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F. The
        first two symbols determine red intensity, the two in the middle -
        green intensity, and the last two - blue intensity.
        -->
        <p style="color: white;">Hex method:</p>
        <p style="background-color:#aa78aa;color:#aaaaaa">color of text.</p>
        <!--
        In HTML, colors can also be defined in HSL values. HSL stands
        for hue, saturation and lightness:
        Hue is defined in degrees from 0 to 360. On a color wheel, red is
        around 0/360, green is at 120 and blue is at 240.
        Saturation is defined in percentages from 0 (black and white) to 100 (full color).
        Lightness is defined in percentages from 0 (black) to 100 (white).
        Example: To color the background in HTML blue, you could use hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
        -->
        <p style="color: white;">Hsl method:</p>
        <p style="background-color:hsl(175,55%,75%);color:hsl(360,65%,75%)">color of text.</p>
