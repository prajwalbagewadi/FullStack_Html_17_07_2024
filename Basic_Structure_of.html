<!--
A markup language is a type of language used to annotate or describe the structure and formatting of text in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
It uses a set of tags or symbols to define the elements and their relationships within a document, indicating how the content should be structured or displayed.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is used to create webpages. 
It uses HTML tags and attributes to describe the structure and formatting of a web page.
HTML consists of various elements that help define the structure and content of a webpage, including headings, lists, images, links, and more. 
These elements also provide information to search engines and web browsers about how the content should be structured, 
although HTML itself does not directly control how search engines "display" content.


HTML uses predefined tags and attributes to instruct the browser 
on how to display content, including formatting, style, font size, and images. 
HTML is a case-insensitive language, meaning there is no distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters.

tags and attributes:
HTML tags are structural components enclosed in angle brackets. 
They are typically opened and closed with a forward slash (e.g., <h1></h1>). 
Some tags are self-closing, while others support attributes like width, height, and controls 
for defining properties or storing metadata.

There are generally two types of tags in HTML: 
Paired Tags: These tags come in pairs i.e. they have both opening(< >) and closing(</ >) tags.
Empty Tags: These tags are self-closing and do not require a closing tag.” (<tag/>)
